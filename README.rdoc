Mummy Madness is a remake of the old Amstrad game Oh Mummy
that was written for the 7 day lisp game design contest.

The game was originally written in Clojure, but I scrapped that
code and rewrote it in PLT Scheme using the universe and image
teachpacks for DrScheme.

= Running
To see the current progress of the game, simply download the code,
open it with DrScheme and click Run.

If you're on a mac then you can probably download and run a binary
from the downloads section.
